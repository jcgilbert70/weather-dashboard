# Weather Dashboard
challenge 6 server-side api's

## Description
With the use of OpenWeatherMap Api's I created an application that allows the user to input a city and get the current weather along with the 5 day forecast. The application also stores your search history in local storage and displays all non-duplicate searches on the left side of the screen.

## Motivation
I wanted to use server side API's to create an application that a user can manipulate and recieve selected data from the server side API's. 

## Comments
I have added comments to more easily understand what each block of code is doing. I added several consol logs to better see what is happening as the application is being manipulated. All console logs can be commented out. I ended up making three api fetches, one for current weather, then to fetch the 5 day weather, it required first fetching longitude and latitude from another api. Most likely more efficient ways to go about fetchind required data, it was just how it organically came to fruition while figuring out how to make the fetches and grab the data I wanted.
